## Story
Most of the Premises have Elevator installed in them, but after the outbreak of COVID19 people are concerned about using the Elevators as it involves touching the physical buttons to enter the Elevator Cabin which makes it very unsafe for people travelling by it, as the corona virus can easily spread through these contaminated surface of the elevator buttons. So I have decided to build a Voice Activated Elevator control system which can be installed in any elevator and is very easy to use. By making the elevator control touchless we can minimize the interaction of these contaminated surfaces to the people and can prevent the widespread of Coronavirus.

## HOW DOES IT WORK

I have decided to use the NuMaker-HMI-N9H30 as the brain of this project and have deployed the Alexa Into It, Theni have interfaced the NuMaker-HMI-N9H30 with PCA9685 PWM Driver to drive the Servo Motors. These servo motor are Retrofitted on top of the Elevator Buttons and then trigger according to the Instruction send By the NuMaker-HMI-N9H30 depending upon the User Interaction.
